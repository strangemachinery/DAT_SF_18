Steven Mellor
Originally from New York, moved out to San Jose 8 years ago to elevate my career in technology.
I've worked for major companies like Yahoo and startups with <20 employees.
A good portion of my career has been involved in NOC/SRE(Site Reliabiltity Engineer) work and looking to bring change to my current path.
The current interests would be yoga, hiking, working out, gymnastics, dance, traveling.
